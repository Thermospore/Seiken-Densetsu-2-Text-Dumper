prim wants you to help that witch hunting dude
first

Everyone in パンドーラ王国 had their たましい
抜けた'd, probably because of that 魔女

but first you need a ムチ to get into the witch
forest place? Oh you can just enter from the south

OK now we gotta take ポポイ to the 神殿 to get
the 種子 to try and fix his 記憶喪失

Wait but we need to go to the 妖魔の森 to break
the seal first lol

Dude said something about three people going
upstairs and a ladder coming out? in witch castle

There is a cave you can't enter to the right of
the water temple
